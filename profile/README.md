This organization aims to provide continued build support for selective Minecraft 1.7.10 mods, so you can enjoy the game with some of the greatest mods of the time

As I discover mods that are either hard to find or have gone unsupported, I will add them here. Please reach out to me if you want another mod preserved here. (Discussions in the organization, or any repo works)

If you are a owner of a mod here and wish to take it down, you can reach out to me via email.
